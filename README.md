# Star User 

Under-collateralized lending protocol using verifiable credentials to give a credit score for opening dynamic credit lines and give more power to small and loyal users on Starknet to activate the decentralization of the governance.

### Description

Star User is the Only Dust of users. This under-collateralized lending protocol leverages the on-chain reputation on Starknet to give a credit score, open a dynamic credit line to small and loyal users, allowing them to borrow $STRK, encourage active participation in governance by wrapping $STRK, and improve activity on Starknet thanks to their continuous actions.

### Core Properties

The protocol targets the best Starknet users, with less than $10,000 in their wallets.

1 - Credit Scoring based on on-chain reputation

2 - Dynamic credit line based on your continuous actions

3 - Borrow without any collateral

4 - Safeguarding System

5 - Innovative Loan System

### Liquidity Workflow

### Roadmap

- Notification system to prevent risk when a user is close to the deadline
- Finish and improve the credit score algorithm
- Sybil resistance: detect whales and bot activity to avoid a big amount split in different wallets
- “How to improve your credit score” with a quest system
- Create a community note to open a contest to exclude a user with bad behavior
- Implement Tokenbound Accounts
- A decentralized voting pool system for the governance
- Create an API for protocols to prevent systemic risk by sharing the user credit score with them
